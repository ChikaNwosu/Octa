                    <p>Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes. Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes. Brown-paper packages tied up with strings. These are a few of my favorite things. When the dogs bark, when the bees sting, when I'm feeling sad, I simply remember my favorite things, and then I don't feel so bad. Give me a second, I need to get my story straight, my friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the empire state, my lover she's waiting for me just across the bar, my seat's been taken by some sunglasses asking about a scar. I know I gave it to you months ago, I know you are trying to forget, but between the drinks and subtle things, the holes in my apology, you know, I'm trying hard to pipe it down. So, if the time, the bar closes and you feel like coming down, I'll carry you home... Tonight, we are young, so let's set the world on fire, we can glow brigher than the sun. Now, I know that I'm not all that you got, I guess that I just thought, maybe we cold find new ways to fall apart, but our friends are back, so let's raise a glass cos I've found someone to carry me home, tonight.</p>

                <br>
                <p>As you go through life you see, there is so much that we don't understand. And, the only thing we know is things don't always go the way we planned. But you see everyday whe things never go your way, and it seems all your dreams come undone, we will stand by your side, filled with hope and filled with pride, for we are more than we are, we are one. We are one body, we are one. If there's so much I must be, can I still just be me, the way I am. Can I trust in my own heart, or am I just one part of some big plan.Even those who are gone are with us as we go on, one family under the sun. All the wisdom you need, and all the courage that you need, you will find when you seek, for we are one. We are one body, we are one.</p>
